 * case of accidental network outage your code will make a few
 * honest retries before throwing a runtime exception. Just
 * wrap your actual {@code Sttc} implemntation into
 * {@link ReSttc} and that's it:</p>
 *
 * <pre>Sttc sttc = new ReSttc(
 *   new RtSttc(new URN("urn:github:12345"), "auth-key")
 * );</pre>

Stateful Web Primitives

  This is a Java SDK for a collection of stateful web primitives
  at {{{http://www.stateful.co}www.stateful.co}}.

  For example, you need a lock available online and shared among multiple
  processes running on different nodes in the network. Here is how you
  do it in Java, using this SDK:

+--
import co.stateful.Counter;
import co.stateful.Counters;
import co.stateful.Sttc;
import co.stateful.RtSttc;
import com.jcabi.urn.URN;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String... args) throws Exception {
    Sttc sttc = new RtSttc(
      new URN("urn:github:526301"),
      "9FF3-41E0-73FB-F900"
    );
    Lock lock = sttc.locks().get("my-test-lock");
    new Atomic<Void>(
      new Callable<Void>() {
        @Override
        public Void call() {
          System.out.println("this call is synchronized");
        }
      },
      lock
    ).call();
  }
}
+--

  The only dependency you need is
  (you can also download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/co/stateful/java-sdk/${project.version}/java-sdk-${project.version}.jar}<<<java-sdk-${project.version}.jar>>>}}
  and add it to the classpath):

  <groupId>co.stateful</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
